// Package v1alpha1 represents the v1alpha1 version of extenisons for the
// Cluster Bundle API. These are APIs that are not core to the Cluster Bundle,
// but provide value-add functionality.
//
// These types here are quite experimental and indicate how we think the
// ClusterBundle and components might be used to create clusters.
